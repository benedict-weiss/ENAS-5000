# Shape Approximation

**A foray into the Fourier Transform! Uses the DFT and fourier descriptors to approximate curves and boundaries in 1D and 2D**

Instructions:  
Navigate to project directory with 'cd project'  
Compile and run with 'make && make run'  
Follow printed instructions  

NB geometry.c sets up structs and basic functions, raster.c and draw_input.c handle drawing to the window, and the bulk of the mathematics is in fourier.c. the primary driver is main.c
